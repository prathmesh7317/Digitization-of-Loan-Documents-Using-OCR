# Digitization-of-Loan-Documents-Using-OCR

Developed a Streamlit application that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automatically extract 
relevant data from loan documents (such as Aadhar and PAN cards) using Regex. The extracted information 
is then processed and stored for easy retrieval and verification, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of 
the loan approval process.
